					<p>You don’t have to be a fitness fanatic to enjoy our trips. A typical day consists of a personally paced 5-mile hike or 20-mile bike ride. 
					   We’re flexible, though ”“ we’ll adjust distances and levels of difficulty up or down according to your abilities and desires.</p>
					   <br><br>
					<p>To accommodate our youngest guests, family hikes and bike rides are typically shorter and easier. Our guides are happy to keep children entertained 
					   while adults/teens opt for a challenging hike, bike ride, etc. – distances and levels of difficulty for adults and teens are easy to adjust.</p>
					   <br>
					<p>On adult trips, our minimum age is 16. On designated family adventures, we accommodate children as young as 7 (age 6 for Yellowstone & age 5 on 
					   our Costa Rica Family Adventures). Children who share accommodations with one or more adults will receive discounts of 10 – 25%, depending upon the trip.</p>
					   <br><br>
					<p>We promise an intimate experience with maximum flexibility and personal attention. On most trips, we take 2 guides and an average of 10 to 12 guests. 
					   On family adventures we can accommodate up to 18 guests with 3 guides. We are also experts at planning exclusive and custom 
					   trips ranging from 5 guests to 50 or more.</p>
					<br><br><br>

					<p>Many of our guests travel solo. Solo travelers have the option of paying a single supplement for a private room throughout the trip. 
					   At your request, we will also try to match you up with a suitable roommate. If we’re unable to do so and you are forced into a private room situation, 
					   we will only charge you 50% of the customary single supplement charge (on most trips). 
					   We recommend talking to one of our Custom Trip Experts if this is something you’re interested in.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p>Though our days are busy, there’s always downtime to shop, relax or visit the spa. At any time during your trip, 
					if you feel like putting your feet up instead of opting for the day’s activities, that’s fine. This is your vacation!</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p>Absolutely. Our alumni are some of our best sources of information. Just give us a call and we’ll provide references for the specific trip you’re interested in.</p>
					<br><br><br>
					<p>The farther in advance you book, the better selection of dates you’ll have. On most trips you’ll want to book 3 to 6 months out. 
					   For holiday trips, you’ll want to reserve 6 to 8 months out. Rest assured, though, we’re also masters at accommodating last-minute reservations!</p>
